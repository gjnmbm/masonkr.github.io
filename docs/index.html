		<h1>Welcome!</h1>
		<p>This website shows all the projects I've done, whether they're finished or not. <br>
			Some of these projects I might go back to in order to improve upon it, but if I think it's 
			done I probably won't come back to it. <br><br>
			I do not specialize in web design, but I value functionality over presentation. If I think
			it works, I'll leave it as is.
