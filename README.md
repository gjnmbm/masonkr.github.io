# Portfolio of sorts

This will be a site where I post most, if not all, of my coding projects that I've done. This site will probably show off my personal and professional projects (right now: mostly college programming stuff). This site will link to other webpages I've designed in the past or describe what the project/goal of the project was and what language(s) the program was coded in.
